Research project : Prediction of transcription factor binding sites by introducing new signal thresholds
Proposed method:Using mean-variance stabilization method for introducing new signals for each reads
Evaluation methods:
1.Motif occurence 
2.Correlation of gene expression data with transcription factors

We had a comparison of our method with fold enrichment method and spp.

Result:
Our method showed better results in comparison with the other two methods.

———————————

We used the the MAnorm method for our comparison.

We have devided our comparison into four groups:

1. MAnorm on raw read
2. MAnorm on variance-stabilization signal
3. MAnorm on fold enrichment signal
4. Difference of variance-stabilization signals
